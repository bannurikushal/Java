Coversion of Decimal to Octal?
Ans:To convert a decimal number to octal, we use the method of repeated division by 8.
    Here's how to convert 75 decimal to octal:
    1.Divide 75 by 8:
    75÷8=9 with a remainder of 3
    2.Divide the quotient (9) by 8:
    9÷8=1 with a remainder of 1
    3.Divide the quotient (1) by 8:
    1÷8=0 with a remainder of 1
    Now, read the remainders from bottom to top: 1,1,3.
    Therefore, 75=113

Ans:To convert a decimal number to octal, you use the method of repeated division by 8.
    to convert 200 decimal to octal
    1.Divide 200 by 8:
    200÷8=25 with a remainder of 0.
    2.Divide 25 by 8:
    25÷8=3 with a remainder of 1.
    3.Divide 3 by 8:
    3÷8=0 with a remainder of 3.
    Now, collect the remainders from bottom to top: 3, 1, 0.
    So, 200=310

Ans:To convert the decimal number 127 to octal, we use the method of repeated division by the base 
    of the target number system, which is 8 for octal.
    Here are the steps:
    1.Divide 127 by 8:
    127÷8=15 with a remainder of 7.
    2.Divide the quotient (15) by 8:
    15÷8=1 with a remainder of 7.
    3.Divide the quotient (1) by 8:
    1÷8=0 with a remainder of 1.
    Now, collect the remainders from bottom to top: 1, 7, 7.
    so,127=177
